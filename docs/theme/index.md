# Themes – Sensory vs Arbitrary

In this course we will compare and contrast two of the most common theories of visual cognition – behaviorist and cognitivist approaches. We will look in depth at the literature that has influenced information visualization research over the past thirty years, and explore these theories in two projects, beginning with an investigation into the traditional task based models of perception through an eye-tracking study, and moving into more recent theories of mind based on cognitivist psychology and embodied interactions. For the final project, you will design an artifact that combines your weekly sketched mind maps of each lecture into a format of your choice, that applies the principles learned in the class to the design of said artifact. Your audience will be the general public, such as your friends or families who will not be familiar with the topic but will inform them of the basic principles of visual cognition and how they are integrated into our physical and digital worlds
